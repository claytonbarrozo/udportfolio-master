## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit 8080localhost:
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### My updates
	
	* Created a gulp file 
	* Decreased the size of all the pictures by using gulp
	* Created a minjs file for the minified js files 
	* Compressed all the pictures 
	* I have already run gulp to optimise the CSS and img, all you have to do is to run index.html


	## Main

		* Used imageoptim to decrease the size of the pictures
		* line 454 on the main.js - Moved dx and newwidth out side of the loop and changed the code from document.querySeletorAll() to document.getElementsByClassName()
		* in ChangeSliderLabel I Changed the querySelector to getElementById as its Web API is Faster
		* In windwwidth I changed the code from querySelector to getElementById as its Web API call is faster
		* Moved pzzasDiv outside of the loop so only DOM call is made one.
		* Created a local varibal to save top outside of the loop, this will prevent the DOM being explicitly touched in every iteration.
		* M0ved the container outside of the loop
		* Moved the getElementoBy Id to outside of the look so movingPizzas its WEB API call is faster 
		* Fixed the calcuation in order to move the pizzas
		* Added the getElementsByClassName in updatepositions (mover) instead of querySelectorAll - this makes the code to run faster
		* added container instead of document.getElementsByClassName('randomPizzaContainer')



	## Style.Css

		* added backface-visibility: hidden; in css in mover class
		* In Syle.css the vendor prefixes were included, I used Autoprefixer CSS online.


	## Index.html

		* Added a Script to call external javascript file on pizza.html and index.html
		* in index.html I moved the link to the head instead of the bottom of the html file.
